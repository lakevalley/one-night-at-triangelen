## Important Notice 
- **Make sure to commit a .gitignore file when creating your repo:**  
  `https://gist.github.com/drch-/00d98ab2b93b930f55e0f7c62abc4af2`

## 1. Basic Commands
- **Clone existing repo:**
  `git clone <repository_ssh>`
  
- **Check the status:**  
  `git status`
  
- **Check commit history:**  
  `git log` (Press q to exit log mode)
  
- **Show current branch:**  
  `git branch`

- **Show all branches:**  
  `git branch -a`


  ---

## 2. Working with Branches
- **Create a new branch:**  
  `git branch <branch_name>`

- **First push inside new branch:**
  `git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>`
  
- **Switch to another branch:**  
  `git checkout <branch_name>`
  
- **Shortcut: Create and switch to a new branch:**  
  `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
  
- **Delete a branch (local):**  
  `git branch -d <branch_name>`  
  *(Use `-D` to force delete without checking if it's merged, and discarding changes)*

- **Change working branch**  
  `git checkout <branch_name>`

 - **Checkout from all branches/reset**  
  `git checkout *`

- **View all branches**  
  `git branch -a`

  ---

  ## 3. Adding, Committing, and Pushing Changes
- **Add changes to staging (specific file):**  
  `git add <file_name>`
  
- **Shortcut: Add + Commit in the same command:**  
  `git commit -am "Your commit message"`
    **(Cannot be used when adding new files)**

  - **Add all changes to staging:**  
  `git add .`

  - **Commit changes:**  
  `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

- **Push changes (in current branch):**  
  `git push`

- **Pull the latest changes from remote repo:**  
  `git pull`
  
- **Downloads the state of new data from a remote repository, but it **does not automatically merge** changes into your current working directory. It allows you to see what changes are available on the remote before deciding to merge them with your local branch.**
  - `git fetch`

## 4. Merging Changes

1. **Make sure both branches have a clean head:**
  `git status`
  **For each branch**

2. **Checkout the branch you are working on**
  `git checkout <branch_name>`
  
3. **Merge main into your current branch:**  
  `git merge main`
  
  *(Merges the specified branch (main) into the branch you're currently on.)*

4. **Resolve merge conflicts:**  
  When conflicts occur during a merge, Git will mark the files with conflicts. Youâ€™ll need to edit the files manually, remove conflict markers, and then **add** and **commit** the resolved files:
  `git add <file_name>`
  `git commit`

5. **Test the code for errors**

6. **After conflicts are respolved, and code is tested:**  
  `git push`

7. **Now checkout main and merge your working branch into main** 
  `git checkout main`
  `git merge <branch_name>`
  `git push`
  **done**

  ## 4. Reset & undo
- **If a file is unstaged -> Undo unstaged changes in file:**  
  `git checkout <file_name>`
  
- **If a file is staged -> Reset file to last committed state**  
  `git reset <file_name>`

- **Reset all changes (in branch) to last committed state**  
  `git reset .`
  
- **Checkout from all branches/reset**  
  `git checkout *`
